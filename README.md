# Madrid-property-market-analysis
## Data analysis
This case study is a simulation of the activity performed by a Real Estate company that invests in big cities, with the objective of buying properties that are subsequently rented as tourist apartments. The manager has decided to invest in Madrid, and has commissioned us to analyse the data that the leader company AirBnb makes available to the general public, with the aim to find the types of properties that have the greatest commercial potential for tourist rental.
The expected final outcome requested by the company is the typology of properties that the valuation team should look for among the existing opportunities in the city, and the main neighbourhoods or geographic areas to focus on.

*This case is developed inside the Python Mastery Data Science Program.*
