# Madrid-property-market-analysis
## Data analysis
This case emulated that we are an Inmobiliaria company that make inversions in big cities, the company that we represent buy properties to subsequently rented as tourist flats.
The management has decided to invest in Madrid, and has commissioned us to analyze the data that the industry leader AirBnb makes public to try to find the types of properties that have the greatest commercial potential for tourist rental.
The expected final result that the company wants was the typology of flats that the team of valuations needs to search in the existing possibilities in the city, and the main neighbourhoods or geographic areas in which focus
The main deliverable is the typology (or typologies) of properties that the valuation team should look for among the existing opportunities in the city and the main neighbourhoods or geographic areas to focus on.
